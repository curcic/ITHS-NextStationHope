The street in which the remains of the ancient civilization were found has left the footsteps of the people from the Romans, through the Turks and the Austrians on its cobblestones for centuries until today. <br><br>With the renovation of the Roman and the construction of a new water supply system in the first half of the 16th century, the conditions for the settlement of this street began to emerge. The Turks are building mosques with busy neighborhoods, but after the arrival of the Austrians they were demolished in order to give the street a new look in accordance with the coming time.<br><br></p></div></div></div></div></section><section><div class="container" id="skadarlija"><div class="row align-items-center"><div class="col-lg-6 order-lg-2"><div class="p-5"><img class="rounded img-fluid" data-aos="fade-down" src="assets/img/skadarlija9.jpg"></div></div><div class="col-lg-6 order-lg-1"><div class="p-5"><h2 class="display-4 text-center" data-aos="fade-down">Skadarlija<br></h2><p class="text-center" data-aos="fade-down">You won't believe it, but this fortress was built in the first century, first as a wooden palisade with earthen ramparts, and for centuries it developed into a Roman castrum, a Byzantine castle, a medieval fortress and finally an Austrian artillery fortification.
